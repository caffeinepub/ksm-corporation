# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Shift the storefront theme toward a blue-forward palette while reducing/removing pink/purple tones, keeping the playful/cartoonish aesthetic and maintaining readable, accessible contrast.

**Planned changes:**
- Update global theme color tokens (including light/dark mode variables) to emphasize blue tones and de-emphasize pink/purple hues.
- Replace any explicit Tailwind purple/pink gradient class usages in storefront sections (e.g., featured collection cards) with blue-forward gradient equivalents consistent with the updated theme.
- Verify text and interactive element contrast across updated backgrounds/gradients to maintain readability and avoid low-contrast combinations.

**User-visible outcome:** The storefront UI appears more blue and less pink/purple across sections, buttons, cards, and gradients, while staying playful and remaining easy to read.
