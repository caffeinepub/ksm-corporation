  "summary": "The diff adds the three new homepage sections and wires the homepage to fetch a backend-provided config via React Query with a fallback default. However, the navigation/anchor behavior does not meet the requested category-link scrolling behavior, and the backend method is not implemented as a query as required. The configured brand name also does not reflect the requested \"Coding Company Corporation\" option in the backend-provided config.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Header navigation links must scroll to matching homepage section anchor ids, including for the categories already shown (e.g., men, women, children, infants, jewelry, shoes, pets), and provide a working mobile navigation experience with the same links.",
      "reason": "Mobile navigation exists, but the nav items implemented are Lifestyle/NFTs/Featured/Why Us rather than the specified category anchors (men, women, children, infants, jewelry, shoes, pets). This does not satisfy the acceptance criteria examples for category scrolling links.",

      "id": "REQ-6",
      "requirement": "Backend canister must expose at least one query method returning a single configuration object (store name, hero headline/description, categories id/title/description).",
      "reason": "The backend exposes getConfig as a shared update call (`public shared ({ caller }) func getConfig()`), not a query method as required.",

        "backend/main.mo (public shared ({ caller }) func getConfig() : async Config)"

      "id": "REQ-7",
      "requirement": "Support the brand name \"Coding Company Corporation\" by sourcing displayed brand/store name from backend config and using it consistently for accessible text, with a sensible default.",
      "reason": "While the frontend is data-driven and uses brandName for alt/sr-only text, the backend-provided brandName is hardcoded to \"Linden Storefront\" rather than providing/supporting the requested \"Coding Company Corporation\" option via backend configuration.",
      "evidence": [

    {
      "description": "Backend config changes homepage categories to Lifestyle and NFTs rather than the described multi-category fashion set (men/women/children/infants/jewelry/shoes/pets) that the homepage currently uses by default.",
      "reason": "The request was to provide the category list used on the homepage; swapping to unrelated categories was not requested and also misaligns with the REQ-5 anchor-id examples.",
      "evidence": [
